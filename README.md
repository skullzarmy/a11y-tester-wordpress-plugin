## ‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood

The A11y Tester WordPress plugin utilizes the robust [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library to conduct accessibility testing on your WordPress pages and posts.

### ü§î What is Axe-Core?

Axe-core is an industry standard for web accessibility, providing automated accessibility testing to ensure your web content is compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The library produces a detailed report of accessibility issues, categorized by their level of impact, which aids in prioritizing areas for improvement.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How Does It Work?

Starting from version 1.0.6, the plugin creates a scoped iframe to securely run the accessibility tests. When you click the 'Run A11y Test' button in the A11y Tester meta box on your WordPress admin dashboard, an AJAX request is sent to the server to retrieve the permalink. The plugin then uses axe-core to perform an accessibility scan on the full URL of the selected page or post within a scoped iframe. The server processes the scan and returns the results, which are displayed directly within the A11y Tester meta box, sorted by impact level for your convenience.

### üõ†Ô∏è Future Plans for Customization

As of the current release, the plugin does not allow customization of axe-core's run parameters. However, we are planning to introduce this feature in upcoming versions to offer a more tailored accessibility testing experience.

## üñå Customization

### Overriding Plugin Styles

To allow for more flexible styling customization, the plugin supports the ability to override the default styles. You can do this by placing a cloned version of the `a11y-styles.css` file in your active theme folder, inside a sub-folder named `a11y-tester`.

For example, the structure should be as follows:

```plaintext
- wp-content
    - themes
        - your-active-theme
            - a11y-tester
                - a11y-styles.css
```

When this file is detected in the active theme folder, the plugin will automatically enqueue this style sheet in place of the default one, allowing you to customize the styles as you see fit.

If the file is not found in the active theme folder, the plugin will fall back to using the default styles located in the plugin directory.

To implement this, make sure to update your CSS and keep it in sync with the `a11y-styles.css` file in the `a11y-tester` folder of your active theme.
